# Electroencephalography BioMarker

 Preprocessing Electroencephalography (EEG) signals and employing
 some analytical simulations such as PLV and ttest on them, was 
 the main task of this project. Three group of people(AD:Alzheimerâ€™s
 Disease-norma-MCI:Mild Cognitive Impairment) were examined(By 
 different odor sensing) and brain EEG signals were provided to
 do this task. Moreover, the relation between the three subjects
 and possible transition were analyzed. The was carried out via 
 matlab and toolbox EEGlab.


this is all for github upload limit :)

 for convinient runnung of PROJECT.mlx (or you know check it's addressing in matlab):
 1.put Subject01 & Subject02 next to PROJECT.mlx
 2.go forward and put AD & MCI & Normal in dataset/dataset
 3.dig deeper and put Subject1 & Subject2 dataset/dataset/preprocess
